MIT Language Modeling Toolkit
=============================

The MIT Language Modeling (MITLM) toolkit is a set of tools designed for the 
efficient estimation of statistical n-gram language models involving iterative
parameter estimation.  It achieves much of its efficiency through the use of a
compact vector representation of n-grams.  Details of the data structure and
associated algorithms can be found in the following paper.

  * Bo-June (Paul) Hsu and James Glass.  Iterative Language Model Estimation:
    Efficient Data Structure & Algorithms.  In Proc. Interspeech, 2008. 

Currently, MITLM supports the following features:

  * Smoothing: Modified Kneser-Ney, Kneser-Ney, maximum likelihood
  * Interpolation: Linear interpolation, count merging, generalized linear
    interpolation
  * Evaluation: Perplexity
  * File formats: ARPA, binary, gzip, bz2 

MITLM is available for download under the MIT License. It has been built and 
tested on 32-bit and 64-bit Intel CPUs running Debian Linux 4.0. It currently
requires the following:

  * ANSI C++/Fortran compiler (GCC 4.1.2+)
  * Boost C++ Libraries (1.32+)

The design and implementation of this toolkit benefited significantly from the
SRI Language Modeling Toolkit by Andreas Stolcke.  The vector library is
partially derived from the Flexible Library for Efficient Numerical Solutions
by Michael Lehn.
