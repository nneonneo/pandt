This contains four flite voices compiled for Windows Mobile using the
mingw32ce compiler.  These voices are somewhat specially created in
order for them to be both small and fast to run.

libcmu_us_kal.a
  This is just the standard kal_diphone 8KHz voice as distributed with
  flite, its in this directory to make it easier to link in the multiple
  voice case

libcmu_us_awb.a
libcmu_us_rms.a
libcmu_us_slt.a
  These are 8KHz versions of the standard arctic cg voices, they also have
  reduced orders to 13 (from 25) thus are quite a bit smaller.  They are
  almost fast enough for a 400MHz strongarm (AT&T Tilt).

  These were made in a somewhat hacky way.  The orginal arctic waveform files
  were resampled to 8KHz, then relabeled to be 16KHz (as if the speaker spoke
  like a chipmunk), then the voice was built.  This means the mceps are actually
  every 10ms rather than every 5mz but no part of the code actually know that
  until the very last point.  When the waveform is passed back from cst_mlsa
  the sample rate is crudely re-labeled to be 8KHz.

To link these into flowm, edit the Makefile to uncomment the lines

# OR you can try these specially built voices for WM
# Special 8KH, reduced order (13) voices, seem to be fast enough
# for 400MHz ARM (Tytn II)
#voice_LIBS_flags = -Lvoices -lcmu_us_kal -lcmu_us_awb -lcmu_us_rms -lcmu_us_slt
#EXTRA_CC_FLAGS = -Dcmu_us_kal -Dcmu_us_awb -Dcmu_us_rms -Dcmu_us_slt

The source of these files is also included, you'll have to update the
Makefile's to make them point at compiled version of flite.  These
voices are probably a good idea for the iPhone.
